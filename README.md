# Directed-Reading-Project-
Applied and accepted to participate in Boston University's Directed Reading program Fall 2025. Worked closely under the mentorship of Xuan Loc Huynh, second year mathematics PhD candidate at BU, to learn how to solve/determine behaviors of linear and nonlinear ordinary differential equations. We read and completed exercises from chapters 1-7 in the textbook: 'Differential Equations, Dynamical Systems, and an Introduction to Chaos' by Morris W. Hirsch. Then with the help of Xuan Loc Huynh, I reproduced the results of the first dynamical system modeliing the spread of crime (considering crime contagion) in the paper 'Modeling the Underlying Dynamics of the Spread of Crime' by McMillon D, Simon CP, Morenoff J (2014). A threshold at which the system will approach a low-crime equilibrium can be found by solving the dynamical system and using either phase portraits or it's Lyapunov function to determine potential cases. Results were presented during the Directed Reading Program's final meeting. Please refer to the pdf attached to see results.
