# Directed-Reading-Project-
Applied to and participated in Boston University's Directed Reading program Fall 2025. Worked closely under the mentorship of Xuan Loc Huynh, second year mathematics PhD candidate at BU, to learn how to solve/determine behaviors of linear and nonlinear ordinary differential equations. We read and completed exercises from chapters 1-7 in the textbook: 'Differential Equations, Dynamical Systems, and an Introduction to Chaos' by Morris W. Hirsch. Then with the help of Xuan Loc Huynh, I reproduced the results of the first dynamical system modeling the spread of crime (with the consideration of crime contagion) in the paper 'Modeling the Underlying Dynamics of the Spread of Crime' by McMillon D, Simon CP, Morenoff J (2014). A threshold at which the system will approach a low-crime equilibrium can be found by solving the dynamical system and using either phase portraits or it's Lyapunov function to determine potential cases. Results were presented during the Directed Reading Program's final meeting. Please refer to the pdf attached to see results. 

The short python code attached helps demonstrate the accuracy of Euler's Method when finding the estimated behavior of a function at a future time. During the presentation, it demonstrated a method in which we can predict behaviors of dynamical systems. Please note that Euler's Method is only one example of an approximation method.
